### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

    Lab 4 was fun to code. I liked having to learn how to use different data
    types and have them convert into different measures. Coverting Inches 
    into Feet was fun! The conversion of the dates is cool too.


* Lab 6

    Lab 6 part-2 was fun. There was trial and error in order to get the output
    right. I kept getting the same number for some reason and then I learned 
    when reviewing the code that I wrote the return statements incorrectly.
    Once I changed that the program worked how it is expected to be.

* Lab 7

    I liked lab 9 because it showed me the importance of using const when
    making a program to separate incorrect selling. In part-1 where I had 
    to input 5 numbers and get rid of the highest and lowest ones was hard,
    but I figured it out.
